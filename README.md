This bookmarklet adds one-click betting functionality to the Betfair desktop website.

## How it works

* Add bookmarklet to your browser.
* Switch to a market.
* Click bookmarklet to enable one-click betting.
* Click X button to disable one-click betting.

Please note: currently you need to enable one-click betting individually on each market. Also, if you switch to a new market and "BFA Stake" is already there you need to click on X then on the bookmarklet again.
